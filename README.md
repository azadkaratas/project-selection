# project-selection
Good news for teachers and students. Now students must be as quick as possible to get their project first.

## Firstly get your database and hosting credentials and fill the following parts in index.php:

* $servername = "";
* $username = "";
* $password = "";
* $dbname="";

## Then you should create 2 tables in your database:
1. projectesTable: This table holds the projects information which are:
* **projectName**: project name
* **projectID**: unique ID of project
* **isEmpty**: shows if project is Full or Empty
* **projectCapacity**: is the number of student who can take project
* **student1**: student #1 for the project
* **student2**: student #2 for the project
* **student3**: student #3 for the project
* **timeTaken**: shows when the project is taken
